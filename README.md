# Notepad++ "Notepad" Theme
Welcome to the theme!

It's super easy to use:  
1. Download the latest release from the releases page
2. Extract the file into the Notepad++ configuration directory (for Windows, %appdata%/Notepad++)
3. You're done!

For Notepad++ v8, you must manually select the theme in the Style Configurator to enable it after extracting.

Keep in mind this will override any Notepad++ settings you currently have.

While line highlighting and line numbers are disabled by default, we do support them, so if you'd like to enable them you can do so :)
